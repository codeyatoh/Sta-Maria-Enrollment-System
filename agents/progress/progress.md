## Current phase
Phase 10 - Testing and Deployment (Completed)

## Completed tasks
- Phase 10: Installed `vitest` and configured `vitest.config.ts`.
- Phase 10: Created unit tests for enrollment validation schemas.
- Phase 10: Created unit tests for RBAC role normalization.
- Phase 10: Created unit tests for analytics service logic.
- Phase 10: Authored `/docs/deployment-playbook.md` for operators.
- Phase 9: Created `roles.ts` to normalize role casing.
- Phase 9: Created `ProtectedRoute.tsx` and `UnauthorizedPage.tsx`.
- Phase 9: Wired `/admin`, `/teacher`, `/parent` routes with `<ProtectedRoute>`.
- Phase 9: Created `auditService.ts` for immutable action logging.
- Phase 9: Created `enrollmentValidation.ts` for zero-dependency schema validation.
- Phase 9: Created `firestore.rules` (deny-by-default with RBAC).
- Phase 8: Created `LoadingSpinner.tsx` — reusable Suspense fallback component with animated spinner and message.
- Phase 8: Refactored `App.tsx` — heavy dashboard routes (`AdminDashboard`, `TeacherDashboard`, `ParentPortal`) now use `React.lazy` + `Suspense` for code-splitting.
- Phase 8: Created `batchService.ts` — type-safe Firestore batch write utility with 500-op chunking, `bulkSet`, `bulkUpdate`, `bulkDelete` helpers, and partial-commit error logging.
- Phase 8: Created `firestore.indexes.json` — composite indexes for all critical collection queries (enrollments, attendance, grades, classes, payments, announcements, healthRecords).
- Phase 8: Updated `firebase.json` — registered `firestore.indexes.json` so indexes are deployable via `firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes`.
- Phase 7: Created `healthAnalyticsService.ts` to calculate BMI and aggregate nutritional status.
- Phase 7: Created `HealthDashboardView.tsx` with BMI pie charts and feeding program eligibility lists.
- Phase 7: Updated `AdminDashboard.tsx` to include the Health & Nutrition navigation tab.
- Phase 7: Created `SF8ReportDocument.tsx` (Learner's Basic Health and Nutrition Report) printable view.
- Phase 7: Updated `ReportsView.tsx` to include SF8 in the official reports list.
- Phase 6: Created `ReportLayout.tsx` — reusable print-wrapper, DepEd header, media-query abstraction.
- Phase 6: Created `reportDataService.ts` — typed SF1Data/SF4Data composition from live Firestore queries.
- Phase 6: Refactored `SF1ReportDocument.tsx` to consume typed `SF1Data` props via `ReportLayout`.
- Phase 6: Refactored `SF4ReportDocument.tsx` to consume typed `SF4Data` props via `ReportLayout`.
- Phase 6: Updated `ReportsView.tsx` — async generate flow, error handling, per-report success indicator.
- Phase 5: Added client-side search by subject name in `SubjectsView.tsx`.
- Phase 5: Implemented client-side pagination (10 items per page) in `SubjectsView.tsx`.
- Phase 5: Hid `subject.code` from read-only views (table and view dialog) to reduce cognitive load.
- Phase 5: Preserved `subject.code` in Add/Edit forms to maintain strict backward DB compatibility.
- Phase 3: Installed `recharts` and `date-fns` for robust charting.
- Phase 3: Created `analyticsCache.ts` for optimized Firestore read caching.
- Phase 3: Implemented `analyticsService.ts` for aggregating dashboard KPIs.
- Phase 3: Developed `EnrollmentTrendChart.tsx` (AreaChart) and `AttendanceStatsChart.tsx` (PieChart).
- Phase 3: Refactored `DashboardView.tsx` layout to use live analytical chart components.
- Revalidated all Phase 1 analysis artifacts before Phase 2 execution.
- Verified architecture, database findings, reusable modules, and migration safety plan.
- Implemented additive Phase 2 schema contracts:
  - `schemaVersion` for enrollment evolution
  - `requirementUploads` enrollment metadata map
  - `enrollment_documents` metadata collection
- Implemented migration-safe utilities:
  - patch builder: `buildPhase2EnrollmentPatch`
  - plan builder: `buildPhase2EnrollmentMigrationPlan`
  - runner: `createPhase2EnrollmentMigrationPlanFromDb`, `applyPhase2EnrollmentMigrationPlan`
- Implemented secure file upload architecture:
  - MIME + file-size validation
  - storage path sanitization
  - upload metadata persistence
- Implemented parent upload workflow:
  - new `RequirementsView`
  - learner selection + upload
  - upload history and verification status display
- Implemented admin verification workflow:
  - new `DocumentVerificationView`
  - pending/all/approved/rejected filtering
  - approve/reject actions with rejection reason
- Added attendance backward-compatibility adapter:
  - canonical `attendance` reads preferred
  - fallback to legacy embedded enrollment attendance
- Generated Phase 2 operations documentation:
  - migration runbook
  - upload security strategy
  - phase verification checklist

## Pending tasks
- Environment-level deployment of Firestore/Storage security rules (policy artifact not yet tracked in repo).
- Production migration dry-run/apply by operator using migration runner utilities.

## Blockers
- Repository currently has no checked-in Firestore or Storage rules file for enforcement verification.
- Current architecture is frontend-only; privileged workflow security depends on external Firebase rules configuration.

## Migration status
- Destructive migrations: none.
- Additive migration utilities: completed.
- Enrollment compatibility strategy: completed.
- Manual operator runbook and rollback notes: completed.

## Testing status
- `vitest` (Phase 10): 20 tests passed.
- `tsc --noEmit` (Phase 10): passed — zero errors.
- `tsc --noEmit` (Phase 9): passed — zero errors.
- `tsc --noEmit` (Phase 8): passed — zero errors.
- `tsc --noEmit` (Phase 6): passed — zero errors.
- `eslint` (Phase 6 files): passed — zero warnings.
- Global `npm run lint`: pre-existing failures in `teacherData.tsx` and `MyChildrenView.tsx` unchanged (not touched by Phase 8).
- Manual Firebase-integrated workflow test: pending environment execution.

## Implementation notes
- Phase 2 implementation follows additive-only schema policy.
- Existing enrollment and attendance behavior remains backward compatible.
- Parent/admin workflows were integrated using modular services to avoid provider-level logic duplication.
- Canonical project tracking remains under `/agents`; `/.agents` is preserved for local skill tooling compatibility.

## Architectural decisions
- Keep all Phase 2 schema changes additive and idempotent.
- Keep UI integration limited to parent and admin portals only.
- Introduce migration runner utilities without forcing auto-execution.
- Preserve existing stable domain providers while incrementally introducing service boundaries.

## Bugs encountered
- Existing lint errors in unrelated stable modules prevent full-repo clean lint.
- No checked-in Firebase rules artifact in repository for policy validation.

## Fixes applied
- Added Phase 2 migration-safe schema + service + workflow modules.
- Added compatibility adapter for attendance data source mismatch.
- Added operational documentation for migration and upload security strategy.
- Removed Phase 2 file warnings (unused imports and display text cleanup) from touched modules.

## Next steps
## Next steps
1. Execute the `deployment-playbook.md` step-by-step.
2. System modernization complete. Monitor for post-deployment issues.
