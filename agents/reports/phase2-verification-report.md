# Phase 2 Verification Report

Date: 2026-05-27
Scope: Required pre-implementation verification items before and during Phase 2 execution.

## Verification checklist

1. Analysis documents reviewed
- Reviewed:
  - `/agents/analysis/codebase-analysis.md`
  - `/agents/analysis/database-analysis.md`
  - `/agents/analysis/api-analysis.md`
  - `/agents/analysis/security-analysis.md`
  - `/agents/analysis/performance-analysis.md`

2. Progress tracker reviewed
- Reviewed `/agents/progress/progress.md` and reconciled implementation state.

3. Architecture findings verified
- Verified the current SPA + Firebase client-heavy architecture remains unchanged.
- Confirmed Phase 2 changes were isolated to service-layer additions and targeted portal views.

4. Database analysis verified
- Confirmed additive-only schema evolution path:
  - new `enrollment_documents` collection
  - additive `schemaVersion` and `requirementUploads` fields on `enrollments`
- No destructive schema mutation introduced.

5. Reusable modules verified
- Reuse points confirmed:
  - `src/components/ui/*` primitives
  - context providers in `src/lib/*Data.tsx`
  - new modular services under `src/lib/services/*`
  - migration helpers under `src/lib/migrations/*`

6. Migration safety plan verified
- Migration patch generation remains idempotent and additive.
- Added dry-run/apply migration runner utilities in:
  - `/src/lib/migrations/phase2MigrationRunner.ts`
- Rollback remains a read-path rollback and additive-field ignore strategy (no destructive rollback required).

## Result
- All six required verification checks are completed.
- Phase 2 implementation may proceed and remain constrained to database-safe modernization scope.
