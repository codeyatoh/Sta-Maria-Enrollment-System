# Documentation Analysis Report

Date: 2026-05-27

## Reviewed artifacts
- `/README.md`
- `/SKILL.md`
- `/docs/School-Forms-Digitized-Report-v.1.0.pdf` (25 pages, extracted for analysis)

## Coverage summary
- Functional process documentation: strong in PDF manual.
- Technical architecture documentation: minimal.
- Data model documentation: missing.
- Security/RBAC technical specification: missing.
- Deployment/runbook and rollback references: missing.

## Key alignment observations
- Manual describes MATATAG-compliant workflows and expected SF forms.
- Codebase currently implements core flows partially:
  - Enrollment, attendance, grades, and BMI encoding are present.
  - SF1/SF4 templates exist but are not fully data-bound.
  - SF5/SF8/SF9 generation remains placeholder in current UI logic.

## Gaps to close
1. Architecture overview tied to actual code modules.
2. Firestore schema and migration reference.
3. Security and RBAC policy document.
4. Reporting engine data contract and form mapping reference.

## Outputs created from this gap analysis
- `/docs/architecture-overview.md`
- `/docs/implementation-reference.md`
